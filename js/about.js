    "I'm software engineer with a strong web development background originally from the suburbs of Chicago. I like engaging problems on the frontend, backend, in the cloud and everywhere in between. I like finding elegant solutions in js, python, and always love an excuse to learn a new language, framework, or concept.",
    "I have a passion for creating interactive web experiences, especially ones that leverage random behaviour to surprise and delight users a different way every time.",
    "I also have over a decade of experience in graphic design, image manipulation, and freelance writing, and my other interests include IoT, chatbots, image recognition, NLU, and machine learning.",
    "I'm interested in a wide variety of projects, and would always love to hear more about what you're working on!"
